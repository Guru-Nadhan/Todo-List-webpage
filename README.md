# To-Do List web-page

This repository contains the code for a To-Do list webpage which uses local storage to keep track of the list items. This concept is implemented using JavaScript .

The user can add tasks, mark them as completed and also delete tasks.

#### Webpage: [https://guru-nadhan.github.io/Todo-List-webpage/](https://guru-nadhan.github.io/Todo-List-webpage/)
#### Languages used:
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - JavaScript
#### IDE: 
Microsoft Visual Code Studio
###### There is one small problem. The local storage keeps track of the tasks added and deleted by the user. But it doesn't check if the task was marked as completed or not.
